          The
          <a href="#btn-pitch-chart-pass-clusters" class="link-to-button"
            >Show Pass Clusters</a
          >
          chart shows the clusters where Pogba starts his passes from. Any
          number of clusters shows that Pogba is a box-to-box midfielder.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 5 or more clusters, a pattern emerges which shows that the largest
          clusters come from the right half-space (the highlighted area on the
          pitch) which makes sense as the majority of the time, Pogba played as
          the right defensive midfielder alongside MatiÄ‡ during that season.
          Generally speaking, the clusters get smaller the further away from the
          right side of the pitch.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the number of clusters is 10 and % of passes shown is 100%, the
          same as the number of outfield players in a match, interesting
          formations like 3-4-3, 3-3-4, and 4-3-3 emerge. The chart shows Pogba
          gets involved all over the pitch, helping the defenders pass out from
          the back, starting attacks from the defensive midfield position, and
          creating chances from outside the opponent's box. The left-wing
          cluster also has more passes than the right-wing cluster due to Pogba
          playing a few games in that position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="#btn-pitch-chart-shot-map" class="link-to-button"
            >Show Shot Map</a
          >
          chart shows Pogba likes to shoot mostly from the left half-space but
          isn't very accurate. It also shows he's not afraid to get into the box
          and score.
        </p>

          >
          chart shows that Pogba mainly creates chances and assists from deep in
          midfield but occasionally gets into the box and wings to create.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This essay has shown that Pogba is a box-to-box midfielder that likes
          to go all over the pitch but mainly operates in the right half-space
          to pass, make things happen, and control the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pogba excels at using his physical abilities to win duels and 50/50
          challenges. His goal and assist output rival the best attackers in the
          league despite playing deeper. Where Pogba can improve is the
          defensive side of the game. However, after looking at his strengths
          and weaknesses, it's clear that the numbers point to Pogba being
          better utilised as an attacking midfielder that doesn't have to worry
          as much about defence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Pogba is one the best-performing players in his team when
          compared to the attackers and defenders.
